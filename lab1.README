Mathew Sherry, 1-30-15, WebGL program to display different shapes on successive clicks.

Quick Note: I have it so you have to click the screen to initialize the program (sorta);

How I got to the solution: I created a program, using examples from Angel, that displayed a square on the screen. I then made three sets of vertices (one set per shape).
I added an onClick event where the program will switch shapes to display, place their vertices, and then render them.
